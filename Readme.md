# ToDo App Variations

This repository contains multiple versions of a ToDo application built using **Vanilla JavaScript** and **React**. The purpose of this repo is to explore and implement different ways of building a ToDo app, focusing on both frontend and backend logic.

## Goals

- Learn and practice how ToDo applications can be implemented with minimal frameworks (Vanilla JS) as well as modern libraries (React).
- Understand different ways of storing and managing data: using files, MongoDB, and a simple global array.
- Experiment with UI rendering, event handling, and CRUD operations in multiple ways.

## What This Repo Covers

- ✅ Vanilla JavaScript ToDo app with tasks stored in a global array.
- ✅ React-based ToDo app with dynamic rendering and component-based architecture.
- ✅ Backend logic for storing todos in:
  - Local files (e.g., using Node.js file system)
  - MongoDB (via MongoDB Compass or Atlas cloud)
- ✅ REST API implementation for managing todos (create, read, update, delete).

## Why This Repo?

This is a self-practice project meant to:
- Deepen understanding of frontend frameworks and plain JS.
- Just to practice more on dom how it wokrs under the hood

## Future Scope

- Add user authentication.
- at somepoint we use jwt token for authentication also
- also creates a signup/signin functionality for user
